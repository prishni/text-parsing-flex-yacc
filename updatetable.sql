To<br />realize this, I have proposed the multi-modal interaction mechanism: text, speech and icon. With the text based interaction, English illiterate people can access Internet in their own mother languages. With speech-based interaction, language illiterate<br />people can interact to Internet with their speeches. Icon-based interaction has been devised for people, who can not read/write and even communicate with speech. With this interaction, users input their requirement by selecting icons (graphical symbols),<br />and results are furnished in visual forms. A user interface based on the proposed mechanism can be seen at http://www.nid.iitkgp.ernet.in/Bharati . I have proposed indexing mechanisms to retrieve unimodal and multimodal biometric data at a faster rate with a higher degree<br />of accuracy.<br />A number of automatic software testing methodologies based on UML models have been proposed. The model-based testing technique outperform the code-based techniques&nbsp; in several aspects.<br />I have proposed a number of text entry mechanisms for text entry in the majority of Indian languages. Also, I have proposed an novel method of word prediction in Indian languages.<br />I have proposed a new methodology to apply biometric data to cryptographic application. The proposed methodology is suitable for data storage in distributed environment such as Cloud. Also, using biometric data of users I have developed accurate, efficient and robust authetication protocol and multiparty authentication for a shared resource have been introduced first time.<br />Presently, I am working on hands-free touch-free next generation man-machine interaction, in particular suitable for people with special needs. To do this, I propose to augment brain-computing interaction into the huamn-computer intercation strategy in several applications like e-learning, mental workload modeling, etc.");

The Formal Verification and CAD Research Group, IIT Kharagpur is one of the leading groups in the world in this area, known for its wide range of contributions in CAD for verification of VLSI circuits, automated control systems, networks, and embedded software. The group has collaborated with many leading industries including Intel, IBM, Synopsys, Google, Motors, Indian Railways, National Semiconductors, Hindustan Aeronautics, and Semiconductor Research Corporation.<br />Professor Dasgupta has been named among the top 10 research contributors in Computer Science in India during the period 2002-2014 in a bibliometric study conducted by the Ministry of Science and Technology.<br /><br />The words <em>Cyber-Physical Systems</em> and <em>Industrial Internet of Things</em> are buzzwords today in the EECS community. Software based embedded control is everywhere -- including home consumer electronics, power grids, handheld and wearable devices, automotive and avionics applications. CPS design requires interdisciplinary skills &ndash; control theory, electronics and design automation, and software. At IIT Kharagpur, researchers from Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science have come together to address some of the emerging research challenges in automotive control, safety critical avionic software, digital and analog integrated circuits, railway signalling and train control systems, and smart electrical grids. The formal verification and CAD research group offers an opportunity for addressing the challenges in studying such systems and proving that they are safe.<br /><br />Recent focus of the research group, in addition to its traditional strengths in circuits and systems, includes automotive and avionic control systems, security of automotive electronics, railway technologies and embedded safety critical software.<br />&nbsp;");
